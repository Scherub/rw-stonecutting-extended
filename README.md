## FAQ

Can this mod be added and removed safely?

> This mod can be added at any time. Removing this mod **should** only result in a one-time-error message and the loss of any set stonecutting bulk bills. Just to be on the safe side, it is advised to create a separate save game.

Does this mod work with stonecutting workbenches from other mods, such as the ones from *Vanilla Expanded*.

> Yes, it does. As long as the other mod defines a workbench as *TableStonecutter*, the bulk recipes should show up.
