## FAQ

Can this mod be safely added and removed at any time?

> This mod can be added at any time. Removing this mod **should** only result in a one-time error message and the loss of any set stonecutting bulk bills. Just to be on the safe side, it is advised to create a separate save game.

Does this mod work with stonecutting workbenches from other mods, such as the ones from *Vanilla Expanded*.

> Yes, it does. As long as the other mod defines a workbench as *TableStonecutter*, the bulk recipes should show up.

Why is there no 'make any stone blocks x3' recipe?

> Because the recipe won't work without changing the code, as the amount of resulting stones is defined in the source object itself instead of the recipe. I could overwrite the responsible method, but there are other mods modifying the same method. As it is easy with this mod to set up single work orders, I decided to just remove this recipe.
