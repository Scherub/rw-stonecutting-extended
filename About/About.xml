  <description>Mod Version: 1.0\n\n\nShows bubbles when pawns perform a social interaction with the text that would normally only be found in the log.\n\nBubbles will fade away after a short time but they are linked to the game time so pausing the game will halt the bubble from fading. Hovering over a bubble will make it nearly transparent and they can be clicked through to objects underneath. Use the toggle button in the play settings area to disable bubbles from being shown.</description>
